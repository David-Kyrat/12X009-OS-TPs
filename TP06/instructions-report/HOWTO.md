 # Implementation Plan

## Objectives

- Create processes with the `fork()` function.
- Handle those processes, especially avoid zombies.
- Handle the signals sent to the shell.  


## Features  

#### User can

- Interact with system
- Execute commands


### Shell must

- Create multiple processes (`fork`)
- Handle those processes (avoid zombies)
- Be able to use builtin commands (`cd <dirname>` and `exit <exit-code>`)
- Be able to execute jobs, i.e. system's programs (e.g. `ls`, `pwd`, `ps`...)

## Parsing  

### Comment lire l'entr√©e utilisateur ?

- Split the input string to an array than can be used like `argv`, `argc` (c.f. `main`)  

- In our case we will consider that the space and the tab are the only 2 arguments separators.
  - Consult the `strtok` function in the manuel. The `realloc` function can also be useful.


```C
  char* token = strtok(userinput, ""); 

  while (token != NULL) {
    printf("%s\n", token);
    token = strtok(NULL, "");
  }

```

## Jobs

When the users enters a non-builtin command:  

- Shell will create another process to execute the program with the `execve` call  
```C
  include <unistd.h> 
  int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```  


Shell will wait for the child_number process to end then display its exit code
if it's available. (e.g. "Foreground job exited withcode 0"),
or if it is not: a simple message (e.g. "Foreground job exited")
